## Abstraction 抽象

The process of removing complex code from the scripts where other programmers will see it, and only exposing the functionality other programmers really need. When you "abstract out" the details, you reduce duplicate code and provide easy access to the most useful methods. The goal of abstraction is to keep your code as clean as possible, and simple for other programmers (or yourself) to use. 

## Inheritance 继承

The process of creating a primary class from witch other classes, referred to as child classes, can be created. A child class takes on all of the features of the primary, or parent class, automatically. This reduces the need to rewrite code that both classes would need to make use of.

## Polymorphism 多态

Allows you to create alternative functionaity code that's been inherited from a parent class.

## Encapsulation 封装

Similar to abstraction, its overarching purpose is to sepatate the programmer from code complexity, but the focus here is more on code safety in the form of accessibility. Encapsulation gives you tools to code for other programmers, and make sure that they only use your variables and methods as intended.
