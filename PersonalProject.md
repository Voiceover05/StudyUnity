## Give objects basic movement
Before you spawn objects into your sceen, they should move the way you want.
*Check "Basic Gameplay" and "Gameplay Mechanics" in the project concept.*
1. If relevant, add **Rigidbody** components to your non-player objects
2. Do Objects no need to jump or move in other direction (rigidbody-freeze position)?
3. Add a new script for moving, apply to all the objects need movement (`public float speed` makes easy to change speed of different objects).
## Destroy objects off-screen
